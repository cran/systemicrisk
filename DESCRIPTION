Description: Analysis of risk through liability matrices. Contains a Gibbs sampler for network reconstruction,  where only row and column sums of the liabilities matrix as well as some other fixed entries are observed, following the methodology of Gandy&Veraart (2016) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.2016.2546>. It also incorporates models that use a power law distribution on the degree distribution.
